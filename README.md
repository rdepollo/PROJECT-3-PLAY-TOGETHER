# PROJECT-3-PLAY-TOGETHER
A web-based synthesizer using Firebase and Pizzicato.
INTERACTION III | CCS FALL 2018 | ROB DEPOLLO & MELANIE MERCADANTE

This projet is an attempt to communicate the experience of playing music with others in a way that would be accessible to both musicians and non-musicians. Users tap on bubbles to play notes from the c major scale. Multiple users playing together can create rich chords and complex melodies. Sound is generated using the Pizzicato library (https://github.com/alemangui/pizzicato) and the database runs on Google Firebase (firebase.google.com).
